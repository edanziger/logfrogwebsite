<h1>About LogFrog DB</h1>

<p>LogFrog DB is a diabetes tracking application with powerful, innovative features you need to manage diabetes quickly and on the go.  It was created by Elon Danziger and Yelena Rubinshteyn with graphic design assistance and illustration by Rui Martins and Monia Nilsen. LogFrog DB lets you track blood glucose values and all the factors that affect blood glucose, including insulin or oral medication, carb intake, and exercise.  Great for kids and adults, LogFrog DB will keep you organized and help you analyze and better understand your data. Our team, which includes a Type I diabetic, hopes to motivate you with a look-and-feel you’ll enjoy using again and again! We would love to hear from you at <a
